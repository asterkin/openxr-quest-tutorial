# OpenXR Quest Tutorial - Project Plan

> **Repository**: `openxr-quest-tutorial`
> **Target**: Meta Quest 3 (Horizon OS v81, Android API 34)

## Current Status

-   **Completed**: Phases 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
-   **In Progress**: None.
-   **Next**: Phase 6.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Prerequisites
**Status**: ✅ Completed
-   Development tools installed and environment configured. OpenXR SDK is managed automatically via Gradle/CMake.

### Phase 1: Repository Foundation
**Status**: ✅ Completed
-   The core repository structure, documentation framework, and build system foundations are in place.

### Phase 2: `hello_world` Sample
**Status**: ✅ Completed
-   A minimal OpenXR sample to verify basic environment setup and instance creation.
-   **Location**: `openxr/hello_world/`

### Phase 3: `hello_xr` Sample
**Status**: ✅ Completed
-   The canonical Khronos `hello_xr` sample, adapted as a standalone project for Quest 3. Demonstrates a full rendering loop and multi-API support.
-   **Location**: `openxr/hello_xr/`

### Phase 4: `openxr-tutorial` Series
**Status**: ✅ Completed
-   A progressive, multi-chapter tutorial series adapted from openxr-tutorial.com, demonstrating core OpenXR concepts from setup to advanced rendering and interactions.
-   **Location**: `openxr/tutorial/`

### Phase 5: Meta SDK Samples Migration
**Status**: ✅ Completed
-   Samples from the Meta OVR Mobile SDK have been imported and integrated to demonstrate Quest-specific features and OpenXR extensions (e.g., Passthrough, Hand Tracking, Spatial Anchors).
-   **Location**: `meta/`

### Phase 6: Upgrade to Recent Tool Versions
**Status**: ⏳ Planned
-   Upgrade the toolchain and language standards across the projects to more recent versions. This includes:
    1.  Upgrading to C++ 20.
    2.  Updating the Android NDK to version 25 or newer.
    3.  Streamlining Gradle, NDK, and C++ versions across all samples for consistency.
    4.  Adding auto-cleaup to meta build.gradle to remove zomby icons

### Phase 7: Connect to Context7 MCP
**Status**: ⏳ Planned
-   Integrate with the Context7 MCP (Mission Control Platform) to automate the generation and maintenance of up-to-date project documentation based on the codebase.
