# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the OpenXR Quest Tutorial project.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs document architecturally significant decisions—choices that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques of the project.

## Purpose

ADRs serve to:
- Preserve the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Provide a shared understanding of architectural principles
- Help contributors understand decision rationale
- Enable the project to evolve systematically
- Prevent re-examination of previously settled questions

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change being proposed or implemented
- **Consequences**: The resulting context after applying the decision

## Current ADRs

| ADR Number | Title | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| [ADR-0000](adr-0000-use-adrs-to-document-architecturally-significant-decisions.md) | Use ADRs to Document Architecturally Significant Decisions | Accepted |
| [ADR-0001](adr-0001-consolidated-tutorial-repository-for-openxr-quest-samples.md) | Consolidated Tutorial Repository for OpenXR Quest Samples | Accepted |
| [ADR-0002](adr-0002-workstation-level-prerequisite-installation.md) | Workstation-Level Prerequisite Installation | Accepted |

## Creating New ADRs

ADRs are numbered sequentially (ADR-0000, ADR-0001, etc.) and stored as Markdown files in this directory.
