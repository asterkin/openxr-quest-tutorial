# OpenXR Quest Tutorial

> Learning and reference repository for OpenXR development on Meta Quest 3

---

## Overview

This project offers self-contained OpenXR tutorial samples, organized by complexity from minimal setup to advanced features. Its main objective is to accelerate the onboarding process for software engineers who possess basic C/C++ familiarity but are new to the specifics of Mixed Reality technology. It also aims to provide a ready-made starting point for new development by demonstrating core OpenXR and MetaXR features in a simplified form.

This is a **tutorial and learning repository**, NOT a production development environment.

## Target Platform

- **Device**: Meta Quest 3
- **OS**: Horizon OS v81 (Android API 34)
- **Graphics**: Vulkan 1.0.3+
- **XR Runtime**: OpenXR 1.0.34

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the tutorial samples:

1.  **Set Up Your Environment**: Before you can build and run the samples, you must configure your workstation. Follow the detailed instructions in the **[Environment Setup Guide](docs/Environment_Setup.md)**.

2.  **Explore the Samples**: Once your environment is ready, browse the available samples. For a gentle introduction, we recommend starting with the `hello_world` sample.
